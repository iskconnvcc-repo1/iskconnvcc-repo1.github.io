<p style="text-align: left;"><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Ratan Gupta (RG) is a wealthy industrialist, well-known for being charitable to noble causes. He recently attended an ISKCON program at a friend&rsquo;s house, where the speaker Sanatana Swami (SS), a venerable monk who has been teaching God consciousness for the last 35 years, invited him to visit the local ISKCON temple. One early evening, Ratan decides to go to the temple. As he parks his car outside the temple, he notices hoardings depicting a grand new temple that ISKCON is planning to build. He enters the temple, has &apos;darshan&apos; (entering the temple room and seeing the Deities) and enquires about Santana Swami. He is directed to a small room, where he sees the effulgent Swamiji sitting erect on the floor behind a small desk. The room is filled with pictures of Krishna on the walls and books about Krishna in the shelves. Sanatana Swami greets him with a warm smile and invites him to take a seat. Their conversation:</span></p>

So many people are suffering without food, clothing, and shelter. Isn&rsquo;t that a much more urgent necessity for society than an expensive temple?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Certainly it saddens our heart to see people suffering without the basic necessities of life. Many humanitarian organizations are working to help them and much more can be done. At the same time, a temple plays a vital role in the integration and the development of the entire community, a role that is not being played at all in our modern society.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Just as food, clothing and shelter are the basic needs of the body, peace is a basic need of the mind. Today, there is practically no system to provide for this basic mental need. Worse still, our fast-paced, stress-filled lifestyle agitates our mind a lot. No wonder the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that the greatest medical challenge of the current century will be not AIDS or cancer but mental health problems. The temple is one of the few places where one can immediately experience a deep peace just by going into the premises.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>RG (looking thoughtful): When I entered the temple I was wondering how it is such a haven of serenity despite geographically being amidst the hustle-bustle of the city. Where does this tranquility come from?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: The tranquility is a natural result of the divine vibrations that constantly pervade a temple. Those vibrations result from both the presence of the Lord in His deity form as well the constant chanting of His holy names. Many, many people come to the temple in the evening to de-stress themselves before returning home. They take darshan of the deities, attend the worship or sit in the temple hall taking in the divine atmosphere. Thus they become mentally recharged to cope with the challenges of life.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Peace of mind is not a luxury, but is a necessity that enables us to perform our duties sustainably. To lift a 5 kg weight for a few minutes is not difficult. But if we were to lift it continuously for the rest of our lives, it would soon become a burden, an unbearable burden. We would need to relieve ourselves of the weight by short breaks that would allow the muscles of our arm to rest and regain strength. Similarly our duties &ndash; and the anxieties that inevitably come with them &ndash; are like burdens on our minds. If we let these burdens weigh on our minds constantly, they exhaust us mentally. We need short breaks that allow our minds to rest and regain strength.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>People try to get these breaks through entertainment &ndash; by watching TV and movies.

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>On the other hand, when we come to the temple, we take those mental burdens off and sooth our minds with the healing serenity that pervades the temple. Then when we are mentally rested and refreshed, we restart our duties with greater effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>In fact, because people don&rsquo;t take such nourishing breaks, they become ineffective in their personal functioning and irritable in their interpersonal dealings, leading to so many avoidable problems.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>RG: I had never thought of the temple contributing to society by providing mental rest.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: You are not alone in that. I too had hardly any idea of the value of our culture till I came in contact with ISKCON, And I would surmise the same holds true for most Indians, including even those Indians who are proud of their culture. That&rsquo;s what makes the next contribution of the temple to society &ndash; education &ndash; so vitally important. Many temples offer a tranquil atmosphere, but ISKCON temples particularly offer spiritual education too.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Science tells us how to do things, but spirituality alone teaches us why to do things. For example, the medical colleges teach how to cure a patient, but they don&rsquo;t teach why to cure him. Consequently, many doctors see their patients as money minting machines and often subject them to needless tests and treatments so as to earn more out of them. Similarly, in every profession, when the motive of earning takes primacy, professionals end up exploiting their clients.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: The purpose of real education is not just to train students in technical skills, but also to rectify the lower human tendencies. Sadly, modern education fails to do that. Learning is not just for earning, but for service.</span></p>

Think of how much better our world would be if everyone were working to serve each other, not exploit each other. Spiritual education can create that culture of service.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Being good and doing good or living by moral principles is like following traffic laws for smooth and safe travel. The purpose of travel, however, is not merely to follow the laws but to reach the destination. If a traveler feels that the traffic laws delay or obstruct his reaching the destination or that there&rsquo;s no policeman to catch him, he will soon become tempted to break the laws.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Like traffic laws, moral principles promote order, specifically orderly social interactions. But modern education doesn&rsquo;t teach us about the goal of social transactions or the goal of life itself. So, most people chose by default the incessantly glamorized goals of modern consumerist society&mdash;wealth, enjoyment, prestige, power, possession, position. The Bhagavad-gita, which has been acknowledged as a philosophical masterpiece by Emerson, Einstein, Gandhi and many other thinkers worldwide, explains graphically how such a materialistic worldview leads to corruption and degradation. When the social culture aggressively propagates materialistic goals and education does nothing to counter this propaganda, then morality appears unnecessary and even undesirable, resulting in the mentality: &ldquo;If the goal of life is to earn money and enjoy life, then why be honest, when honesty will severely limit my earning and enjoyment? By hook or crook, earn and enjoy. There&rsquo;s no God in front of whom I have to account for my deeds; there&rsquo;s only this one life for me to enjoy. I just have to make sure that whatever I do, I do it cleverly enough to not get caught.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS (nodding): More the materialistic propaganda spreads, more the immorality increases &ndash; and not just in earning, but also in every form of enjoyment. According to the US Congressional Quarterly, in the 1960s, the top disciplinary problems in US schools were sticking gum under school desks, noise during classes, breach of dress code, littering the classroom and running in halls. Now, the top disciplinary problems in US schools are drugs, alcohol, pregnancy, suicide, rape, robbery and assaults on teachers. And as India is becoming westernized, soon these problems will come here also.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>RG (nodding gravely): It&rsquo;s scary when we hear about incidents like students shooting co-students and teachers as happened in Virginia Tech a few years ago. But how can spiritual education counter this?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Ultimately, everyone is seeking happiness. Spiritual education helps us understand where to find the highest happiness. Most people seek materialistic happiness, but such happiness is always temporary; we have to lose it all at the time of death &ndash; and sometimes even earlier. Moreover, even that temporary happiness is illusory. The Bhagavad-gita explains that we are not our material bodies, but are spiritual beings, souls. We are temporarily occupying material bodies, which are like our vehicles. Satisfying the body by material enjoyment is nothing more than giving fuel to the car. Just as car fuel cannot satisfy the car driver, material enjoyment cannot satisfy the soul and so it is essentially illusory. And worse still, even this illusory happiness always brings misery with it. The Mahabharata explains that before we acquire material pleasure, we hanker for it; when we acquire it, we worry about losing it; when we inevitably lose it, we lament over the loss. We can summarize the nature of material enjoyment by the acronym TIME: Temporary Illusory Miserable Enjoyment.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Spiritual education doesn&rsquo;t stop with condemning material happiness; it also points the way to a better form of happiness, a source of happiness that can never be taken away from us. The Vedic texts explain that as souls, we all have an eternal loving relationship with the all-attractive Supreme Lord. In loving and serving God, we can relish supreme and everlasting happiness; the more we love God, the happier we become. The scriptures of the other great religions like Christianity and Islam also describe love of God as the ultimate goal of life. Hence, love of God is the nonsectarian, universal, spiritual goal of life.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>RG (thoughtfully): Love for God as the ultimate goal of life? Isn&rsquo;t that too other-worldly and impractical? And how does that lead to morality?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Love for God certainly directs our vision to the other world, the eternal spiritual world beyond the temporary material world. But this other-worldly goal does not make us impractical; rather, it builds the most solid foundation for living practically in this world. Just as when we switch on the master switch in a house, all the lights in the house automatically turn on, love for God similarly results in love for all living beings. We realize that all of us are brothers and sisters in the one universal family of God. When we love all living beings, we no longer desire to exploit or manipulate others for our selfish interests. Instead, our love for God inspires us to love and serve each other. This creates a culture of warmth, trust and service, which encourages moral behavior. This contrasts sharply with the modern culture of alienation, suspicion and exploitation, which fosters immorality.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>When we follow a genuine spiritual path, even in its early stages, it triggers our inborn value system. We intuitively realize that God is our greatest well-wisher and that the rules He has made for us are in our ultimate interest. So we voluntarily and lovingly choose to lead a life of moral and spiritual integrity, as ordained by God, And as we find inner happiness by loving God, we become freed from selfish, lusty, greedy, and egoistic drives. No longer do we feel we are missing something because of our morality. Morality ceases to be the &ldquo;difficult but right&rdquo; choice. Rather we choose morality as the natural path to our spiritual growth.</span></p>

Unfortunately, over the centuries, this emphasis on spiritual education was lost; the culture remained, but the philosophy explaining the purpose of the culture became inaccessible to most people.

Additionally, in the evenings, devotees conduct systematic courses on the Bhagavad-gita in the temple as well as in several other parts of the city where the temple is located. These courses lead students from the basics of spirituality like scientific, logical proof for the existence of the soul and God to advanced principles like analysis of the identity and the personal nature of God. Our temples also have a weekly satsang program every Sunday, where hundreds of people come to the temple for a spiritual get-together comprising of a discourse, kirtan and Prasad for everyone. And the results are there for everyone to see. Connected with this temple itself, there are over two thousand people who, by receiving spiritual education, have started leading pure lives free from all bad habits and have started seeing their jobs as a service.

Similarly, millions of people worldwide squander billions of dollars on self-destructive indulgences like smoking, drinking and drug addiction.

The hippies had rejected mainstream society as aimless, and mainstream society had rejected the hippies as useless. But Srila Prabhupada taught these hippies the ultimate aim of life, healed them of their drug addiction and other bad habits by training them in chanting the holy names and elevated them from ignorant self-destruction to enlightened self-realization. This transformation of hippies into &ldquo;happies&rdquo; was nothing short of a miracle. The US government, despite all its national resources comprising of hospitals, doctors, social welfare plans and social workers, had come to its wits end about how to change or even tackle the hippies.

Gradually it became an addiction. To get money for his compulsive drug needs, he started robbing people and stores in 1992. While robbing a shop in 1993, he took a heavy overdose and fell unconscious. On regaining consciousness, he found himself in a prison hospital. He came to know that the shop owner had called the police, the police had rushed him to a nearby prison hospital and the doctors had battled for hours to get him out of the jaws of death.</span></p>

Heartbroken at being separated from his recently-wed wife, he resolved he would never have anything to do with God henceforth in his life. Soon, however, he realized that the withdrawal pains and the physical and mental rigors of prison life would be impossible to endure without some spiritual solace. In USA the crime rate has been spiraling unabatedly for several decades and the expenditure of the US government on prisons is astronomical. Secular efforts to reform prisoners have met with hardly any success, so the US government allows its prisoners to attend reformation programs conducted by various spiritual organizations. Chris attended classes on Christianity, Buddhism, Kabbala, Sufism, Islam &ndash; whatever was accessible in the prison, but nothing helped. After two years of fruitless groping, from the innermost core of his heart, he offered a fervent prayer to God, begging for help.</span></p>

Within days after the prayer, he came in touch with an ISKCON prison minister, who mailed him a copy of Bhagavad Gita As It Is. His physical hardship, mental agony and spiritual searching combined to make him a ripe candidate for enlightenment. From his very first reading, he felt as if he was being revived by a breath of fresh air. He could perceive the eternal truths within the message of the Gita: I am a not the body, but the soul; I am suffering in material existence due to my forgetfulness of God.

In fact, though he was physically within the prison walls, he felt himself more free in spirit than he had felt ever before in his life because he was no longer shackled and tormented by self-destructive desires. Within the prison itself he became a vegetarian and started offering his food to the picture of Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita. He soon became inspired by his Gita study to start practicing nishkama karma yoga in the prison, doing his assignments in a detached dutiful devotional spirit. Not only did he experience complete release from his drug addiction, but he became so composed, integrated and self-satisfied that he emerged as a source of inspiration and solace for his fellow-prisoners. In 2000, he was released from prison. As soon as he returned home, after the initial courtesies, he started teaching his daughters chanting so as to equip them to protect themselves when they would enter the turbulent teenage years. In 2001, he had a divine inspiration to share his good fortune with the many other souls who were languishing in the prisons of America and so he joined the ISKCON Atlanta prison ministry. Now the same Chris, who was formerly a hardened criminal, is now actively serving as a prison minister for numerous prisons in Atlanta, reforming many, many lives ravaged by crime.

The mahamantra &ldquo;Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare / Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare&rdquo; contains three seed words Hare, Krishna and Rama. Krishna and Rama are names of God. Krishna refers to God&rsquo;s all-attractive nature and Rama refers to God&rsquo;s being the reservoir of all pleasure. Hara (changed to Hare in the vocative) is the name of the energy or the consort of God. All of us are children of God. So when we chant the holy names, we basically call out to our divine parents.

Our material positions and possessions &ndash; indeed, all the things of this world &ndash; keep changing, for change is the only thing constant in this world. But God is beyond all the changes of this world. So, the unchanging object of meditation is God. Just as a boat in an ocean is shaken by the waves, our mind is shaken by the ups and downs of life. Just as the flow of waves never ends, the ups and downs never end. And just as the boat is made steady when it is anchored, similarly the mind can be made steady by fixing it on God.

Silent meditation, as done through breathing exercises and yogic postures, tries to achieve this by negating the material, by deactivating the body and the mind.

But since we&apos;re habituated to physical and mental activity, wouldn&apos;t it be easier and more natural if somehow the body and the mind could be used to connect ourselves with spiritual reality? That is precisely what sankirtana does. Engaging the body in graceful dance for the pleasure of the Lord, and the mind in prayerful contemplation on the sound of His holy names quickly and joyfully transports us to spiritual consciousness.</span></p>

When we are joyful within, then we interact with others to share our joy with them. But when we are empty within, we are inevitably craving for external pleasures. So, when we interact with others, then consciously or unconsciously, we tend to manipulate and exploit them to get what we want from them. In fact, when a person is in material consciousness, that is, seeking pleasure externally, his first default thought on meeting anyone is: &ldquo;What can this person do for me?&rdquo; On the contrary, when a person is in spiritual consciousness, that is, satisfied internally, his first default thought on meeting anyone is: &ldquo;What can I do for this person?&rdquo;</span></p>

There&rsquo;s another important way in which purification can make a massive difference in society. When our hearts are pure, we can understand God&rsquo;s plan to do good to the world and can harmonize our plans with His.

Let&rsquo;s understand this more clearly.</span></p>

The root cause of all problems in the world is twofold: man&rsquo;s forgetfulness of God&rsquo;s plan and man&rsquo;s vain attempt to impose his own plan. For example, consider the environment. God has made a perfect plan for the ecology to cleanse and balance itself. We humans take in oxygen and give our carbon dioxide during our respiration. The plants counterbalance by taking in carbon dioxide and giving out oxygen during their photosynthesis. But we forgot God&rsquo;s plan for us to live in harmony with nature by simple living and high thinking. Instead, we imposed our own plan of mass industrialization and urbanization globally, and cut down trees indiscriminately, thus upsetting the delicate atmospheric balance. And we all know the consequences of that.</span></p>

And both these require a pure heart. God has endowed us humans with free will, so we can choose whether to cooperate with Him or not. If we are pure-hearted, we naturally choose to cooperate with him. Consequently, we become further purified, others become benefited and the world functions harmoniously. But if we are impure-hearted, we act according to the dictates of the germs in our mind and end up causing suffering to ourselves and to others. To save us from similar future suffering, God then unfolds an alternative plan aimed at reforming our errant, non-cooperative, impure mentality.</span></p>

Nonetheless, we can still express our desire to cooperate with His plan by purifying our hearts and by chanting His holy names, which constitutes a prayer for serving Him. God promises in the Gita (10.10-11), &ldquo;For those who serve Me with love, I purify their material desires, and give them the intelligence to understand and participate in My plan.&rdquo;</span></p>

They would make it their top priority to visit temples every day, hear spiritual wisdom from saints, find time in their daily schedule for prayer and chanting and thus purify their own hearts. For example, King Kulashekhara, a famous saintly king of South India, would submit at the end of each working day a report of the day&rsquo;s activities in his court to the Deity. His mood was that the kingdom belonged to the Deity and that he was just a caretaker serving on behalf of the Lord.</span></p>

So the temple is like a community from the past transported into the present that offers modern leaders a living example by studying which they can redefine their priorities.

And it can also be the place where future leaders can be trained to lead in harmony with God&rsquo;s plan.

And the farther we go from Him, the more we become vulnerable to impurities. So the essence of any purificatory program is to bring us closer to God.

Just as a currency note is different from ordinary paper, the Deity is different from ordinary stone.

But if a red box is authorized by the post office and one puts one&rsquo;s letters there, they are sure to reach their prescribed destination. Similarly, if one worships a form made according to one&rsquo;s own imagination, then worship of that form is not worship of God.

Their steadfast dedication is itself living proof of the presence of the Divine as the Deities.</span></p>

Srila Prabhupada would say that if we go to God to ask for bread, then that shows our love for bread, not our love for God.</span></p>

The Vedic texts assert that this loving propensity can be completely and eternally fulfilled only when it is directed to God. When a person has one or more of the six principal opulences &ndash; beauty, wealth, intelligence, strength, fame or renunciation, that person becomes attractive in our eyes. Being supreme by definition, God possesses all these cherished attributes in full eternally; He is thus supremely beautiful, supremely supremely wealthy, supremely intelligent, supremely strong, supremely famous and supremely renounced. God has many names that refer to His different qualities, like Allah, Yahweh, Jehovah. But the cumulative result of all His qualities is that He is universally attractive and the name that describes Him best is the name that refers to His all-attractiveness. That name, according to the Vedic scriptures, is Krishna, which in Sanskrit means all-attractive. sarva akarshati it krishna &ldquo;That Supreme Being who attracts everyone is known as Krishna.&rdquo; Over and above these six attractive qualities, Krishna also has an especially endearing seventh opulence &ndash; a most loving nature. In the spiritual realm, He personally and individually reciprocates with the love of each soul. Krishna is thus the perfect object of love and the soul&rsquo;s longing for love, when reposed in Krishna, finds everlasting fulfillment.</span></p>

Simply out of love &ndash; love for Krishna and love for all of Krishna&rsquo;s children. When Srila Prabhupada was living in the bowery amidst the hippies, he would not just speak Bhagavad-gita to them; he would also cook for them, serve them prasad, even wash their plates after they left. Why was he doing all this for them? What was the relationship between him and them? Materially they could not have been more different; he was elderly, they were young; he was a distinguished Sanskrit and religious scholar, they were college dropouts; he was a clean, cultured gentleman, they were unclean, unkempt derelicts; he was a pure devotee, who had never known any bad habits throughout his life; they were rebellious addicts, habituated to meat-eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex. So the relationship between Srila Prabhupada and the hippies was spiritual; Srila Prabhupada saw them as beloved children of Krishna, who had a slight spark of interest in knowing about Krishna.

Then you take him home in your car, and arrange for his bathing, food and treatment.

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: It is only when we love Krishna that we can truly love others &ndash; including our family members. The more people neglect or reject God, the more their view of life and family becomes materialistic and they see their family members as nothing but facilitators for their enjoyment. When they stop getting the desired enjoyment from their family members, they dump them as fast as they would dump a broken down TV. No wonder that with the increase in godlessness and materialism, joint families have disintegrated into nuclear families. And sadly now nuclear families are breaking into solitary protons and neutrons wandering aimlessly in search of love. The Bollywood idea of love is very superficial; nowadays men and women say that they love each other, but actually men treat women like sex machines and women treat men like ATM machines.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: But that harsh reality can be changed. When we put God at the center of our hearts and families, then we see our family members as representatives of God in our life and we naturally serve them with respect and love instead of using them for our purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Moreover, when our hearts are devoted to God, then God uses us as His instruments to express His infinite love for all His children. When we become carriers of divine love, our expressions of love fully satisfy the hearts of our loved ones. In an ideal family, the vertical relationship with God and the horizontal relationships among the family members reinforce each other. Our vertical relationship makes us more tolerant and service-oriented in our horizontal relationships and our horizontal relationships become means for us to serve Krishna and thus develop our vertical relationship. Thus, the temple helps us develop our love not only for Krishna, but also for our family members.</span></p>

But isn&rsquo;t it also true that some people give up their family responsibilities due to their devotion to God? In your temple, you have so many young brahmacharis who have given up their duties to their parents.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Firstly, there are not so many brahmacharis; as compared to the total number of ISKCON devotees, the brahmacharis will be just about one percent.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Secondly, we make sure they don&rsquo;t just give up their duties, but rather complete their basic family responsibilities. They help arrange for their sisters&rsquo; marriages, they repay their family loans, they arrange for the future financial security of their parents. Only then do we allow them to join as brahmacharis.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Thirdly, they are not actually giving up duties; rather they are taking up higher duties, in fact, the highest human duty of purifying one&rsquo;s heart and developing one&rsquo;s love for Krishna. Only when people see living examples of purity and devotion will they be inspired to pursue those goals themselves. The brahmacharis strive to become such examples by leading a life of simplicity and austerity, waking up daily latest by 4 am and engaging in rigorous spiritual practices.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Yes, the brahmacharis participate in the morning program without fail. At 4:30 am, the Deities offer Their first darshan of the day and the devotees worship Them by performing mangala arti. The artis and kirtans continue till 5:30 am. Then from 5:30 am to 7:30 am, the devotees chant japa. Then at 7.30 am, the Deities after being bathed, dressed and decorated, offer darshan again, after which we have guru-puja. Then we have class on the Srimad Bhagavatam till around 9 am. During the day, the brahmacharis render various services in the temple. And in the evenings, they go out to conduct programs in different parts of the city. In this way, by living a life centered on Krishna, they develop their love for Krishna and share that love with others.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Fourthly, even from a social point of view, the brahmacharis take up higher duties, duties so vital and valuable that they leave no time for other duties. They leave a small family to make the whole of humanity their family and work tirelessly for the welfare of thousands of people. Earlier, we discussed how the temple is like a university. The brahmacharis are like the professors in the university. Today spiritual education is so desperately needed in society, so many people are living aimless, misdirected lives and so few teachers are available to show them the way. Being unconstrained by family demands, the brahmacharis use their purified intelligence and youthful energy to share spiritual wisdom far and wide. Earlier we discussed how the temple is like a hospital administering medication to sick minds. Well, the brahmacharis are the full-time doctors in that hospital. There are so many spiritually sick people, there is such a great need for spiritually qualified doctors and the brahmacharis are the few gallant souls who take up the noble cause of treating the sick.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>And lastly, we never force anyone to become a brahmachari; in fact, we test their inspiration and determination by making them aware of the challenges of life in the renounced order. Only those rare souls who are inspired to dedicate their lives to a glorious cause take up the challenge of becoming a fulltime spiritual teacher. In Vedic culture, those who would sacrifice their lives to teach God&rsquo;s message to society were considered glorious, just as now those who sacrifice their lives to join the army and defend the country are considered glorious. Initially, the parents are upset when their sons leave them, but over the years when they see their son&rsquo;s pure, noble lifestyle and his committed service to humanity, they start appreciating what he is doing and even start practicing devotional service themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Srila Prabhupada was the first spiritual teacher who translated &ldquo;bhakti&rdquo; not just as &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;, but as &ldquo;devotional service&rdquo;. He did this to counter the prevailing misconception that bhakti is just a matter of the heart, a notion that is often used for shirking from doing anything practical for serving God. Certainly, bhakti is a matter of the heart, but what is in the heart is expressed in one&rsquo;s words and in one&rsquo;s actions and in one&rsquo;s very life. When a mother loves her child, she serves the child by cooking a delicacy for him.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: By engaging whatever we have &ndash; our talents and resources, our intelligence and our energy &ndash; in serving Krishna. One important way to render service to Krishna is by building a majestic temple for Him. That&rsquo;s why in Vedic culture, the kings would consider it an honor to have the opportunity to build a temple for the Lord. Sometimes, a temple would be so magnificent that several generations of successive kings would build it together. Indeed, the ethos prevailing then was such that the kings would consider it a matter of pride for their dynasty and their kingdom to have built a temple for the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Yes. The essential principle of devotional service is that our love will be seen when we offer Krishna the very best that we can. So, as per his capacity, the king would offer the Lord a grand temple. Others would offer their best as per their capacity. For example, in Vedic culture, the artists would utilize their artistic talents to glorify the Lord. Through drama, dance, music, painting, sculpture, the artists would depict the pastimes of Krishna, thus flooding their audience&rsquo;s hearts with devotional emotions. Thus everyone &ndash; the artists, the patrons and the audience &ndash; would become purifying remembrance of Krishna and thus joyfully advance in God consciousness.</span></p>

With the advent of TV, movies and internet, many children are not even aware of the basics of their culture. Recently, I had invited to give a talk in a school. When I asked the children whether they had heard of Lord Narasimhadeva, they replied that they had heard only of Narasimha Rao.

In Vedic society, the temple was like the cultural capital. So if we start with a vibrant temple, then the culture will radiate outwards to the whole society from there. And that&rsquo;s exactly happening in many ISKCON temples. For example, in our temple, we have an active drama team comprising of children, youth and congregation devotees. These amateur artists perform skits and plays on Janmashtami and other festivals depicting the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Yes.

So by offering a part of our earnings to Krishna, we are actually Krishna a place in our heart.</span></p>

If we loved someone deeply and wanted to give that person a gift, we would give the best that we could, not give some useless or leftover item from the household junk. Similarly, if we are serious about our relationship with Krishna, we will offer Him the best that we can.</span></p>

I have not seen many people who think so seriously in terms of a relationship with God. Changing the topic slightly, I have noticed that ISKCON is not reviving the traditional culture, but is also using a lot of modern gadgetry.</span></p>

So a devotee does not renounce the world; rather he engages the whole world in Krishna&rsquo;s service. As people are attracted by hi-tech displays, a devotee uses technology to depict Krishna&rsquo;s teachings and pastimes, and thus attract people to Krishna. For example,</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: Yes. In fact, Srila Prabhupada went even further. He felt modernization could even be used to counter westernization; he envisioned a grand East-West synthesis: spreading Indian spiritual wisdom with Western material technology. He compared the coming together of Vedic spirituality and modern technology to the coming together of the proverbial blind man and the lame man. But for this synthesis to take place, the technologically advanced West has to recognize that it is lacking in spiritual vision. And the financially-crippled India has to shed its deeply-ingrained inferiority complex arising from material poverty and recognize its wealth of spiritual knowledge. Srila Prabhupada was one Indian who fully recognized India&rsquo;s unnoticed wealth and wanted to share it with the whole world. Thus when he went to USA, he told the Americans that he had come not to take, but to give. When a flippant British reporter asked Srila Prabhupada on his arrival in London, &ldquo;What is the purpose of your visit?&rdquo; Srila Prabhupada eloquently replied, &ldquo;When you British ruled India, you plundered India of all her wealth. But you forgot to take the most precious jewel of India. I have come to give you what you forgot to take &ndash; the devotional wisdom of India.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Following in Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s footsteps, ISKCON devotees are working tirelessly at the grassroots level all over the world to bring about the East-West synthesis. When the new temple comes up, it will be a significant step forward in the integration of the ancient India with the modern India and in the holistic development of our great country.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>So let me recap the answer to your question about the need for a big temple:</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>The tranquility of the temple offers essential refreshing breaks that empower people face the stresses of life. To get similar breaks, many people seek entertainment, which is an industry costing millions. When we don&rsquo;t object to the money spent on arranging for that sort of breaks, then why object to money being spent on arranging for spiritual breaks that offer similar and arguably better refreshment for many religious (and even non-religious) people?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>The education provided by the temple helps people lead a life of moral and spiritual integrity, which is the basis that enables people to use all their other education for socially beneficial purposes. When we consider establishing new universities for material education as a sign of national progress, then why not similarly celebrate the building of a university for spiritual education?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>The medication provided by the temple can heal the diseased mentality that impels people to addiction and criminality, both of which cause an enormous drain on the national economy. If we recognize as a social necessity the building of hospitals that heal the body, then why not similarly recognize as a social necessity the erection of hospitals that heal the mind?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>The purification that the temple offers can train talented people to become pure-hearted, selfless, principle-centered leaders. When leaders with character are acutely needed in every organization from the family to the government, then why not welcome an institute that can produce high quality leaders?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>The love that the temple inspires in people can provide them deep satisfaction and dramatically improve their relationships. When relationship conflicts are causing unprecedented misery in society, they why not support an institution that can provide a solid foundation for lasting relationships?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>The engagements offered by the temple help preserve our national culture, and also productively channelize people&rsquo;s talents and energies. When our national culture is being lost at an alarming rate, then why not help a forum that is not only protecting but also reviving it?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>And if one institution can offer all these six benefits simultaneously, why should we not participate and rejoice in its establishment? The bigness of the temple is not a gaudy luxury, but a functional necessity; it has big roles to play, big services to offer. To serve as an effective university for spiritual education, it needs seminar halls, conference rooms and libraries. To serve as a vibrant cultural center that can properly serve the thousands of people who crowd it on festivals, it needs a large temple hall, a large prasad hall and a large pravachan (discourse) hall.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>To conclude, I would like to thank you, Guptaji, for investing so much of your time and thought in this long discussion. The world would be a much better place if we had more people with your level of social concern and spiritual interest.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>RG: It is I who should thank you. Swamiji. To say the very least, this has been the most enlightening discussion I have even had in my life. I will surely do all that I can to help in building the new temple and will also try to get my friends to help.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>SS: If you do that, you will receive eternal blessings from Lord Krishna and you will also benefit the whole society. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'><br></span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif; color: rgb(85, 57, 130);'>Ratan Gupta offers his pranam to Swamiji and takes leave. As Ratan is about to enter his car, he turns to have a last look at the temple. He sees, in the distance, the dignified figure of Swamiji seated behind his desk, studying what looks like an ancient book. As he thinks of all the wisdom he has received that evening, a tear of gratitude fills his eye.</span></p>
